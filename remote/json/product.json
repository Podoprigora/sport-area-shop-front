                "text": "Really like this jacket I purchased the XL because I wanted an oversize jacket and it is definitely that. It was actually too big at first and fit more like a dress. But after washing it and partially drying it (I put it in the dryer until it was damp and then hung it on a drying rack) it is a good length to wear with boots and leggings For reference I am 5'4\" tall, around 155 lbs and a size 12. I purchased the grey in large and I think it will fit better initially but I will be careful not to put it into the dryer. The only reason I didnt give it 5 starts is because I expected the ribbed bottom to go all the way around and it doesn't - the cable knit is to the bottom in the back. Will also wear with jeans and flats.",

I was also very happy about the arrival of the sweater. Tried on - it was too tight for me - unfortunately I have to deduct a star because the size for XXL is quite small. Pity! Since I am stronger and want to dress fashionably, it is always very difficult to get large sizes, and if so, it is usually sold out very quickly. It would be nice if there were more in larger sizes. Otherwise I can highly recommend the sweater!",
